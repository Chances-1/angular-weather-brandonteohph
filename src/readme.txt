Note: If stackblitz is having trouble running this project:
1. Download the project
2. Unpackage the project to desired location
3. In Git Bash, cd to the project location
4. Run npm install to install node_modules
5. Run ng serve

Reason is that stackblitz currently handles the plotlyjs dependency poorly - every SB project where I imported plotly.js was stuck on "Starting dev server"
